# Awesome-Graph Contrastive Learning-with-Heterophily

This repository contains a list of the relevant resources on Graph Contrastive Learning or Graph Self-supervised Learning considering heterophily. We categorize the following papers based on their published years. We will try our best to continuously maintain this repository in weekly manner. If you found any error or any missed paper, please don't hesitate to open issues.

**Graphs with Heterophily (Heterophilous Graphs)**

> Homophily is a key principle of many real-world graphs, whereby linked nodes often belong to the same class or have similar features (“birds of a feather flock together”). For example, friends are likely to have similar political beliefs, and papers tend to cite papers from the same research area. However, in the real world, there are also settings where “opposites attract”, leading to graphs with heterophily: linked nodes are likely from different classes or have dissimilar features. For instance, the majority of people tend to connect with people of the opposite gender in dating graphs, different amino acid types are more likely to connect in proteins, fraudsters tend to connect
to accomplices than to other fraudsters in purchasing networks --Zhu et al [NeurIPS 2020]


Graph Contrastive Learning and Graph Self-supervised Learning with heterophily graphs is an emerging research area
